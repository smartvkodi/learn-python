- "Prime Numbers" are numbers positive an greater than 1 which have no other
factors except 1 and the number itsef;

- "Composite Numbers" are numbers which have more of 2 factors''')

print('''\n1. Examples:
	10 factors = {1,2,5,10}  -> composite number
	24 factors = {1,2,3,4,6,8,12,24} -> composite number
	5 factors = {1,5} -> prime number
	17 factord = {1,17} -> prime number

	1 is neither prime nor composite number

prime numbers = {2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,...}''')
